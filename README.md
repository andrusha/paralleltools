Parallel tools (named in manner to itertools & functools) is a set of common used traversal functions, which is working
in parallel in synchronous or asynchronous manner.

Implementation is based on python `threading` module, so be aware of GIL.

Currently implemented functions are (both sync & async):  

* filter
* map
